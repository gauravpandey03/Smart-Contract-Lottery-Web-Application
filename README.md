# Ethereum 
Ethereum is a blockchain platform that allows developers to create decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code.

#  Lottery or a Game of chance 
# Description:-
 Participants who want to enter the lottery send a certain amount of Ether to the smart contract address.
 This Ether is stored in the contract and becomes the prize pool.

Once the lottery has concluded (e.g., when a certain number of tickets have been sold or
a specific time has passed), the smart contract selects a winner(s) based on the random number(s) generated.

The smart contract automatically transfers the prize amount in Ether to the winner(s) based on the predefined rules.
This is typically done through the contract's code.
